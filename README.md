# Dota 2 Machine Learning Model

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the outcome of Dota 2 matches based on hero drafts. By leveraging the OpenDota API, Flask, and Scikit-Learn, the model achieves an impressive **85% accuracy** in predicting match outcomes.

## Features

- **Hero Draft-Based Predictions**: Predict match outcomes solely based on the selected heroes.
- **Flask Web Application**: Interactive web interface for inputting hero drafts and viewing predictions.
- **OpenDota API Integration**: Fetches real-time hero data to ensure up-to-date predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using Scikit-Learn for reliable and efficient predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bnorum/dota-2-ML-model.git
   cd dota-2-ML-model
   ```


2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```


3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the machine learning model using historical match data:


```bash
python train_model.py
```


This script will process the data and save the trained model for future predictions.

### Making Predictions

To predict the outcome of a match based on a specific hero draft:


```bash
python predict.py
```


Follow the on-screen prompts to input the heroes for each team. The script will output the predicted winner.

### Running the Web Application

To launch the Flask web application:


```bash
cd app
python app.py
```


Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the application interface.
